/**
 * @details
 * This is the default early hardware initialisation routine.
 *
 * It is called right at the beginning of `_start()`, to switch clocks
 * to higher frequencies and have the rest of the initialisations run faster.
 *
 * The application can redefine it
 * for more complex cases that requires inits before DATA and BSS init.
 *
 * It is mandatory on platforms like Kinetis, which start with the
 * watch dog enabled and require an early sequence to disable it.
 *
 * Also useful on platform with external RAM, that need to be
 * initialised before filling the BSS section.
